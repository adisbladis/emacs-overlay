* Emacs overlay for Nixpkgs
** Contents of the overlay

*** Elpa
Daily generations of Elpa.

*** Melpa / Melpa stable
Daily generations of Melpa & Melpa stable attribute sets.

*** EXWM & needed dependencies
This overlay provides fresh versions of EXWM and dependencies. This is
updated daily.

*** Emacs 27
This overlay also provides a fresh version (latest from git) for Emacs. This
is updated daily.

This package is named =emacsGit= in the overlay.

** Usage of the overlay
*** Latest master each rebuild
One way, and probably the most convenient way to pull in this overlay is by
just fetching the tarball of latest master on rebuild.

This has side-effects if packages breaks or things like that you may want
to be in control of which revision of the overlay you run.

Adding the overlay this way will extend your Emacs packages set to contain
the latest EXWM and dependencies from their respective master and make the
package =emacsGit= available. These of course change quite rapidly and will
cause compilation time.
